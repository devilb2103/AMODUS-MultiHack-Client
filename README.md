# AMODUS-MultiHack-Client

Old among us internal I wrote back in 2021 when I had nothing better to do than inject c# into my bloodstream.

This repo is more like a covid lockdown digital souvenir than something i will constantly update for people to compile and use.

This project uses confuserEx for code obfuscation and Costura.Fody for merging all c# assemblies into one file.
## warning
  - all pointers are outdated
  - 2021 me did not write light speed efficient code
  - UI libraries are not updated

If at all you want to try it out and assuming this still works provided you've updated all the pointers, this program uses a custom injector that you can find in my public repos.

Happy cheating :D
