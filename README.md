# AMODUS-MultiHack-Client

An old Among-Us internal I wrote back in 2021 when I had nothing better to do than inject c# into my bloodstream.
This repo is more like a covid lockdown digital souvenir than something that i will constantly update for people to compile and use.

This project uses confuserEx for code obfuscation and Costura.Fody for merging all c# assemblies into one file.

This project is also dependent 2 other (compiled) files to function as expected, from:
- https://github.com/devilb2103/AMODUS_INJECTOR
- https://github.com/devilb2103/AMODUS_internal_dll

make sure to whitelist the folder path or all the files used to prevent your antivirus from deleting project dependencies

## warning
  - all pointers are outdated
  - external libraries used are most probably outdated so manual updation is required before you build it into an exe
  - 2021 me did not write light speed efficient code
  - UI libraries are not updated

If at all you want to try it out and assuming this still works provided you've updated all the pointers correctly, this program uses a custom injector that you can find in my public repos or just click on [this](https://github.com/devilb2103/AMODUS_INJECTOR)

Happy cheating :D
